TO DO

SEQUENCER
- Clean up sequence UX, note overlap, updating elegantly, any random bugs

UI
- Midi Control Mapping
  - Allow user to hit a button then touch the midi device knob to match that knob to that control
- Modulation Enhancements:
  - Implement right click on socket to expand a menu to delete specific connections
  - UI support modulation depth socket parameters ( left click on socket to manage modulation chains as well as depth parameters )
- Misc
  - Improve module add logic so they do not spawn on top of each other.
  - Create max zoom for gui graph panel?
  - Improve UI workflow (e.g., setup must be done before play, we need to get these safegaurds in place )

ANALYSIS / VISUALS:
- read system state and produce helpful visuals on detail widgets
- report out modulation maxes/mins maybe?
- fix the native file explorer gui to be in dark mode (might just be my machine...)

COMPONENT ENHANCEMENTS:
- Support for ADSR envelope to be used monophonically (and thus used as a modulation source anywhere!)

COMPONENTS TO ADD:
- Sequencer (MidiEventHandler)
- Arpeggiator
- Pitchbend support
- Panner
- Phaser
- Chorus
- Reverb
- Mixer (with different mixing strategies so this can support ring modulation, for example)
- Bitcrusher

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Phase syncing to minimize wave interference?
- Tempo Utility? (support multiple independent sequencers staying in sync)
- Support multiple modulation sources connecting to a single parameter (reorderable modulation chain? Or does modulation depth / second order modulation capture this?)

ONE DAY...:
- Envelope that supports drawing curve
- Custom Wavetable Drawing
