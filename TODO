TO DO

SEQUENCER
- Support per-note velocities

UI
- Midi Control Mapping
  - Allow user to hit a button then touch the midi device knob to match that knob to that control
- Modulation Enhancements:
  - Right click context menu to delete specific connections
  - UI support modulation depth, setting modulation strategy, and configuring a modulation chain.
- Misc
  - Improve module add logic so they do not spawn on top of each other.
  - allow naming of components
  - allow grouping of components -- hide internal connections and expose unused, or specified connections.
  - Make save/load functions save/update hardware socket container widget positions.
  - Move component additions to the file bar to make more room for the graph panel, and then create shortcut context menus to quickly add modules
  - remember previous setup selections (save in config), and move setup to menu bar with a shortcut.
  - implement module duplicate
  - no deleting modules in run mode.
  - create a dock and popout system for detail widgets for easier management.
  - Create max zoom for gui graph panel?
  - add sync socket to oscillator (orange?) 

ANALYSIS / VISUALS:
- find optimizations for the spectrum analyzer (seems to run pretty hot)
- create mechanism to send the output of a specific module to the spectrum analyzer (e.g., output of oscillator vs output of filter)

COMPONENTS TO ADD:
- Arpeggiator
- Pitchbend support
- Panner
- Phaser
- Chorus
- Reverb
- Inverter
- Quantizer? 
- Mixer (with different mixing strategies so this can support ring modulation, for example)
- Bitcrusher

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Hard Sync secondary oscillator to primary oscillator.
- Phase syncing to minimize wave interference?
- Tempo Utility? (support multiple independent sequencers staying in sync)

ONE DAY...:
- Envelope that supports drawing curve
- Custom Wavetable Drawing
- export custom synths to VST or LV2 or whatever
