CORE FUNCTIONALITY TODO:

- Implement right click on socket to expand a menu to delete specific connections
- Implement API calls to tell backend when connections are removed
- Implement modulation connection removal logic
- UI support modulation depth socket parameters (with nesting)
- Create control parameter UI forms and controls for each module/modulator (or default forms with standard knobs for simple modules/modulators)
- Improve module add logic so they do not spawn on top of each other.
- Create max zoom for gui graph panel
- Improve UI workflow (e.g., setup must be done before play, we need to get these safegaurds in place )

COMPONENTS TO ADD:
- Oscillator (extend to be a modulator)
- Filter (Module + Modulator)
- Sequencer (MidiEventHandler)
- MidiModulator (start with pitchbend, maybe extend to )
- Panner
- Phaser
- Mixer (with different mixing strategies so this can support ring modulation, for example)
- Sample & Hold
- Bitcrusher

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Phase syncing to minimize wave interference?
- Tempo Utility? (support multiple independent sequencers staying in sync)
- Support multiple modulation sources connecting to a single parameter (reorderable modulation chain? Or does modulation depth / second order modulation capture this?)

ONE DAY...:
- Envelope that supports drawing curve
- Custom Wavetable Drawing
