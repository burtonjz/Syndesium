UI:
- FUNCTIONALITY/FLOW
  - Midi Control Mapping 
    - Dockable parameters and allow users to map them to Midi Control signals 
  - Component Detail Widgets
    - create a dock and popout system for detail widgets for easier management (probably unify with the Midi Control Mapping stuff)
  - Parameter Modulation
    - make modulation depth and modulation strategy accessible via a context menu
    - create a ModulationChain class that supports passing multiple modulation effects to the same parameter (maybe this should be a standalone component, "ModulationMixer")
  - Setup
    - Move setup to the menu toolbar, add shortcut, and add saved hardware midi/audio choices to config file so it loads up when the application loads up.
  - Run
    - Block deletion of components while in run mode. 
- COMPONENTS
  - General
    - upgrade generic components from QDoubleSpinBox to a custom Slider or Dial
    - Support generic parameter collections (have specialized sequencer, but should have a more basic one for elsewhere that I use collections)
    - Ensure that modules do not spawn on top of eachother during add logic
    - Move add logic to a toolbar menu, and make hot keys that open up a context menu to quickly add new components
    - Allow component duplication -- one method where you just copy the component, and another where you copy it with any possible connections
    - Allow naming of components for improved readablitiy
    - allow grouping of components -- hide internal connections and expose unused, or specified connections.
  - SEQUENCER
    - Support per-note velocities
    - Make the horizontal scroll bar scroll with shift+mouse wheel
    - Do not allow sequence notes to be created while the engine is running 
    - Ensure when the sequencer status knob is toggled, that it immediately sends note off signals for any active note (or don't allow toggling during run)


BACKEND:
- COMPONENT IMPROVEMENTS
  - [POLYPHONIC] OSCILLATOR
    - add hard sync feature between two oscillators 
    - Phase syncing to minimize wave interference?
  - BiquadFilter
    - interpolate coefficients (lerp) with smoothing factor
- COMPONENTS TO ADD
  - Arpeggiator
  - Pitchbend support
  - Panner
  - Phaser
  - Chorus
  - Delay
  - Reverb
  - Inverter
  - Quantizer? 
  - Mixer (with different mixing strategies so this can support ring modulation, for example)
  - Bitcrusher

ONE DAY:
- Envelope that supports drawing curve
- Custom Wavetable Drawing
- export custom synths to VST or LV2 or whatever
