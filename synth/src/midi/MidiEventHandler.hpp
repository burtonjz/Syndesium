     * a chained midi event handler to act in isolation in determining when a
     * note should be killed.

     * This means midiEventHandlers receive OFF as RELEASE, where as the end node
     * midiEventListeners are the only ones that actually receive OFF events

     * Importantly, this means that midi handlers that modify the release time should
     * be at the end of the chain, so that other handlers in the chain don't mask the 
     * release time from downstream modules (see Polyphonic Oscillator implementation for 
     * an example into problems that can arise)
