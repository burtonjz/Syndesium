## Overview

Syndesium is a standalone modular synthesis environment where you can create, connect, and configure components to design custom synthesizers.

## Features

- **Fully Modular Architecture**: Create and connect individual synthesis modules (oscillators, envelopes, filters, etc.) in any configuration
- **Polyphonic Synthesis**: Built-in support for polyphonic oscillators and voice management, no bounds on polyphony.
- **Flexible Modulation System**: Every parameter can be modulated by any source through the ParameterMap design
- **Visual Patch Bay**: Draw connections between modules using an intuitive Qt6 interface
- **MIDI Support**: Connect and use any MIDI device for performance control via RtMidi
- **Audio**: Select your desired audio output device with RtAudio support
- **Extensible Design**: Clean separation between frontend and backend enables easy addition of new modules and potential development onto other platforms

## Current Status

**Platform Support**: Linux (currently)

The codebase uses cross-platform libraries (Qt6, RTAudio, RtMidi) and is designed to be extensible to other platforms.

## Prerequisites

### Build Dependencies
- C++20 or later
- Qt6 development libraries
- RtAudio
- RtMidi
- CMake

### Runtime Requirements
- Linux operating system
- Audio system (ALSA, JACK, Pipewire)
- MIDI device (virtual keyboards are supported)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/burtonjz/Syndesium.git
cd Syndesium

cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make
```

## Usage

```bash
# run backend executable
./build/synth/synth

# in another terminal, run front end executable
./build/gui/gui
```

1. **Launch Application**: Start Syndesium
2. **Configure Hardware output/input**: Select your audio output device and midi input device through the setup menu.
3. **Create Modules**: Add audio sources
4. **Create Modulators**: Add modulation sources
5. **Create Midi Components**: Add midi manipulation components
6. **Draw Connections**: Click and drag to connect module outputs to parameter inputs
7. **Play**: Hit play to start the audio loop, and use your MIDI controller or computer keyboard to play your custom synthesizer
